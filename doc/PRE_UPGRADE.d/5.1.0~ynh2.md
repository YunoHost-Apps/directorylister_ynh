With this version, *files path* will change to /home/yunohost.app/__APP__ **symlinked** to /home/yunohost.multimedia/__ADMIN__/__APP__
This will simplify the upload of the files and allow other users to have their own files in different directorylister instances.

**UPGRADING IS NOT RECOMMENDED AND WILL BREAK AT SOME POINT. YOU HAVE TO REINSTALL TO CHOOSE WHICH USER WILL BE GRANTED THE ACCESS TO FILES PATH.**
