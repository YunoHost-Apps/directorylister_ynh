With this version, files path will change to /home/yunohost.app/__APP__ symlinked to /home/yunohost.multimedia/__ADMIN__/__APP__
This will simplify the upload of the files and allow other users to have their own files in different directorylister instances.

If you have files in your app folder, make a copy before proceeding, everything in that location will be deleted.
